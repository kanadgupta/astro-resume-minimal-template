# Astro Resume Minimal Template

A minimal print-friendly resume template with GitHub Markdown-inspired styling. Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and styled primarily with [`github-markdown-css`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) and [GitHub Octicons](https://primer.style/octicons/).

## Getting Started

1. Check out the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#prerequisites) for prerequisites (e.g., Node.js requirements)

2. Edit the content in the `src/content` directory. The Zod schemas in `src/content.config.ts` describe the frontmatter for the Markdown files in `src/content/projects` and `src/content/work`.

> [!NOTE]
> The `src/content/projects` directory corresponds to the "Selected Projects" section of your resume. When Astro scans for Markdown files in this directory, the files are sorted by file name prior to rendering.
>
> The `src/content/work` directory corresponds to the "Experience" section of your resume. When Astro scans for Markdown files in this directory, the files are sorted by the `period` field in the frontmatter prior to rendering. The file name has **no** impact on how these files are rendered in the final output.

3. Install the dependencies and run the development server to preview your content:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

4. That's it! All of the main markup and styling is in `src/pages/index.astro` — feel free to tweak it as you see fit.

## Generating a PDF Export

To generate a PDF export of your resume:

1. (Optional, but recommended) Commit any changes so your branch is clean. The current commit SHA will be appended to the file name (e.g., `pdf-exports/resume-2026-07-06-3d5e64f.pdf`), so this is a good way to ensure that the file name corresponds to your actual changes.

2. Serve the website at `localhost:4321` (either via the dev or build preview server)

3. Run the following command:

```
npm run build:pdf
```

A new PDF will be created in the `pdf-exports` directory.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`     | Installs dependencies                        |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`  |
| `npm run build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `npm run preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying |
| `npm run check`   | Check for formatting/type/etc. errors        |
